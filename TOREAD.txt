Revisit the cells! model and view mixed up for the moment!!!
And add their observer/observable (via their interfaces, also to be created)

Tasks:
- create gauges (mvc format)
- terrain creation (mvc format)
- creation of cells + buildings (mvc format)
- asset creation, poster design (proto)

Then:
each person goes to work on the other's functionality, checks the documentation (understandable?), adds and points out differences with the plantuml, gives his opinion, makes any modifications (please report).
