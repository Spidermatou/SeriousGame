ADD constructors and cardinalities to scheme !!!
Notify into cells

Tasks:
- create gauges (mvc format)
- terrain creation (mvc format)
- creation of cells + buildings (mvc format)
- asset creation, poster design (proto)

Then:
each person goes to work on the other's functionality, checks the documentation (understandable?), adds and points out differences with the plantuml, gives his opinion, makes any modifications (please report).

Any view that inherits from a node will have to contain a static Create() function (which returns a packedscene cast in its own type) and will NEVER be created via constructor, only with this static Create function! (constructors must be private!!)
